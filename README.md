# AI-Powered DevSecOps Forensics

üöÄ A project integrating **AI anomaly detection**, **DevSecOps practices**, and **Kubernetes-based CI/CD pipelines** to provide **real-time monitoring, forensic evidence collection, and automated incident response**.

---

## üîç Project Overview
In modern Kubernetes-based CI/CD environments, security monitoring and forensics are often separate.  
This project bridges the gap by:
- Monitoring CI/CD pipelines and containerized applications in real-time.
- Detecting anomalies and malicious activities using AI/ML.
- Triggering automated incident response (pause builds, freeze containers).
- Collecting and storing forensic evidence in a tamper-proof repository.
- Providing dashboards for visualization and investigation.
